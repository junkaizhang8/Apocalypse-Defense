**Programming Language**: Python 3.7.1

## Programming Description
This program creates a game using Pygame called Apocalypse Defense. The goal of this game is to try and survive 10 waves of zombies without letting the base shield run out of energy. Zombies can come from five different lanes. The user can move their in-game character up or down a lane, using W and S keys. The character is able to shoot bullets that deal damage to the zombies. During gameplay, the user can purchase upgrades or abilities using coins earned from defeated zombies to improve their defense. This includes upgrading their bullet or unlocking abilities. This is also necessary since zombies will become much stronger as the waves progress.

## Programming Assumptions
For the program to run, the user must also have all the necessary png files downloaded in order for the program to properly display them. The program assumes the user will enter an integer between 1 and 1000 when prompted to enter the shield energy. The user must have a decent understanding of English to understand the game rules.

## Features of the Program
There is a game rule option in the main menu where
the user can read through all the core game mechanics to understand what to
do when they play. The game allows the user to return to the main menu at
any time whether it be the rules, shield energy input interface, or during
gameplay by pressing the Menu button. The menu screen offers an Exit button
for users to quit at any time they prefer (or they could just press the red
X on the top right corner of the game window). While at the shield energy
interface, the user is able to delete characters from their input by
pressing backspace if they feel like they would like to change something.

## Restrictions
User can only input an integer that is between 1 and 1000 when
prompted to enter the amount of energy they want for the base shield. The
user cannot delete multiple character in their input for the shield energy
by holding down backspace. The program cannot run unless the necessary png
files are downloaded on the user's computer.

## Known Errors
No known errors.

## Additional Files
All necessary png files
